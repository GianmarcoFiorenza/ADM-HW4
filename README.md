# ADM-HW4
#### Hello Aris 
This respository contains the merged-file PDF of the H-Rank submission and the file named homework.ipynb of the jupiter nootebook.
I immediately started the assignament since the first day. I never code with python before the last few weeks. I can olso say that is likely to say that I never code before, I only did a little project in c++ four years ago. 
I spent most of the 'free-time' added to the hours between the lessons on this homework but I could not finish it. I'm working very hard to impruve my coding skills.
I sometimes exploited the discussions, and I ofthen use google to find accurate function. But I always take only inspiration and I never copy something that i didn't understand before.
I hope and I'm conviced that I will do much better to the next assignament.
